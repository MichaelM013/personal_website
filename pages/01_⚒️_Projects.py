This project involved developing an interactive dashboard in Power BI to analyse order and delivery performance using a synthetic dataset. The dashboard tracks KPIs such as total sales, average order value, units sold, and delivery obligation compliance. It features dynamic filters for year, shipping mode, and product category, with visualisations including maps, bar charts, and ribbon plots. DAX measures were created to evaluate shipping performance by mode and customer segment. The project demonstrates skills in data modelling, DAX, and visual storytelling to support operational decision-making.
